2. Find out (add more context to) using VGAE to discover drugs:
    - how robust is this
    - What should be the selection criteria? Now we are using threshold but should it get more flexible?
    - An idea: On AlphaServer they display structures with confidence levels and condifence granulars, should we adhere to that? Is there a better way of aligning predicted structure with objectives (e.g., biological/pharceutical properties)
